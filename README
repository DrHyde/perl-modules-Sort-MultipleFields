This module provides a convenient way to sort on several fields

To install, do the usual dance:
    less Makefile.PL
    less lib/Sort/MultipleFields.pm
    less t/*
those being to ensure that I'm not being evil.

then do this to install the module:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install (you may need to do this as root)

or to install it and all its dependencies from the CPAN:
    sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install qw(Sort::MultipleFields)'
